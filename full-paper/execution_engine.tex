\section{{\large \SeeDB} Execution Engine}
\label{sec:optimizer}

%As mentioned in the previous section, the \SeeDB execution engine is responsible for
%evaluating the entire collection of potential visualizations and returning the top-$k$
%visualizations in real-time.
In this section, we describe the sharing and pruning optimizations designed
to efficiently generate visualization recommendations.
\removefromtr{Our extended
technical report~\cite{seedb-tr}
describes additional offline pre-computation and pruning techniques.}
