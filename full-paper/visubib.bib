@misc {hotmap,
abstract     = {<p>Online interactive mapping systems are growing in popularity: Microsoft,
                Google, and Yahoo all offer interactive maps, with varying features and qualities
                of aerial photography. For the maintainers and designers of such systems, the
                behavior of users can provide critical cues on how both to improve their
                offerings and understand how users are now interacting with the system. The tools
                needed to track user data for these systems are different from the traditional
                tools of log file analysis. Maps have the advantage of being tied to common-sense
                geography: a world map. In contrast, many log-file analysis tools must create an
                abstract space in which to situate a node-link diagram representing the website.
                Mapping systems lack hyperlinks: while other online systems logically lead users
                between pages, online maps can be scrolled and navigated without clicking links.
                Applying a log-file analysis tool to these systems fails to represent the
                relevant dimensions of a mapping system: reconstructing a path between pages by
                examining referrer logs, for example, cannot apply. A simple reporting of the
                most-requested page requires substantial interpretation: presenting the filenames
                for individual map images is far from intuitive. Instead, the understanding of
                geography can be harnessed to build meaningful log-file visualizations by showing
                the logs as a map.</p>},
