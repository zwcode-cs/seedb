\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sec:experiments}
 
In the next two sections, we present an evaluation of \SeeDB both in terms
of performance when returning visualizations and in terms of user 
studies. In both sections, we report results for \SeeDB on a 
variety of real and synthetic datasets listed in Table 
\ref{tab:datasets}.

%Our goal with the user studies (Section \ref{sec:user_study}), in contrast, is to validate 
%our utility metric by comparing \SeeDB recommendations to ground truth, and to compare 
%\SeeDB to a manual chart construction tool for visual analysis.

% Our performance studies focus on the synthetic and larger real-world datasets that
% exercise the optimization capabilities of \SeeDB.
% Our user studies, on the other hand, use smaller real-world datasets that are easy to
% understand and where \SeeDB latency

In this section, we focus on performance studies, where our goal is to evaluate how well our sharing and pruning
optimizations improve latency, and how our pruning optimizations affect accuracy.
In each experiment, our primary evaluation metric is latency, i.e., 
how long does it take \SeeDB to return the top-$k$ visualizations. 
For experiments involving our pruning strategies, we measure quality of results through two additional
metrics, namely {\it accuracy} and {\it utility distance} (discussed further in Section 
\ref{sec:custom_execution_engine_expts}).
Since we expect data layout to impact the efficacy of our optimizations, we 
evaluate our techniques on a row-oriented database (denoted ROW) as well as a column-oriented database (denoted COL).

The following experiments use {\it earth mover distance (EMD)} as our distance function for
computing deviation (Section \ref{sec:problem_statement}).
% In Section \ref{sec:discussion}, we briefly discuss results of using other distance functions to
% compute deviation.
All experiments were run on a single machine with 8 GB RAM and a 16 core Intel 
Xeon E5530 processor. 
Unless described otherwise, we report measurements averaged over three runs.
%experiments were repeated 3 times and the measurements 
%were averaged.

We begin by presenting a summary of our experimental findings and then dive into performance results 
for individual optimizations.

%  present the overall results of our applying all our optimizations and then dive into
% performance results for each of our optimizations.
% We begin with a study of the DBMS-backed execution engine and examine how far we can
% push conventional relational engines to support a \SeeDB workload.
% The results motivate empirically the need for our custom execution engine.
% We then present our evaluation of the custom execution engine and pruning strategies.
% The datasets used in our experiments are listed in Table~\ref{tab:datasets}.
% We test our 
% techniques on a variety of syntheic as well as real datasets to evaluate 
% their performance and accuracy.
