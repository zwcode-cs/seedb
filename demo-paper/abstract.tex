% DBMS optimizer will explore not only the space of physical plans for Q, but also
% the space of possible visualizations for the results of Q. The output will
% comprise a recommendation of potentially ``interesting'' or ``useful''
% visualizations, where each visualization is coupled with a suitable query
% execution plan. We discuss the technical challenges in building this system and
% outline an agenda for future research.

Data analysts operating on large volumes of data 
often rely on visualizations to interpret the results of queries. 
However, finding the right visualization for a query is 
a laborious and time-consuming task. 
We demonstrate \VizRecDB, a system that partially automates 
this task: 
given a query, \VizRecDB\ explores the space of all possible visualizations,
and automatically identifies and recommends to the analyst those visualizations
it finds to be most ``interesting'' or ``useful''.
In our demonstration, conference attendees
will see \VizRecDB\ in action for a variety of queries on multiple real-world
datasets.
